# Mettle Forge Lab

**Layered architectures for governable language systems.**

Mettle Forge Lab develops systems where constitutional constraints, control behavior, runtime packaging, and deterministic tooling are separated by design — not merged by convenience.

The emphasis is **structural clarity over feature accumulation**.

## The Stack

### ForgeEcosystem

**Constitutional layer**

Defines invariants, membranes, and governance constraints.  
Sets the non-overrideable boundaries.

---

### ConditionalBoundedness

**Control-system architecture**

Specifies switching behavior, contraction/expansion logic, and stopping criteria within constitutional bounds.

This layer governs how behavior adapts.

---

### BoundedRuntime

**Runtime rule deck**

Provides deployable KBIN artifacts and coherence band modeling.

Introduces **no new constitutional invariants**.  
Implements and translates upstream architecture into portable runtime form.

---

### DataDiddler

**Deterministic semantic tooling**

A mechanism-level tool for inspecting and structuring document meaning.

Operates independently from switching and governance layers.

---

## Dependency Structure

DataDiddler operates at the tool layer.

- Constitution governs invariants.
- Control governs switching behavior.
- Runtime governs deployment packaging.

---

## Posture

This organization publishes versioned architectural artifacts in public.

It is not a product funnel.  
It is not a manifesto.  
It is not a feature aggregation surface.
