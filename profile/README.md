# Mettle Forge Lab

# 

# Layered architectures for governable language systems.

# 

# Mettle Forge Lab develops systems where constitutional constraints, control behavior, runtime packaging, and deterministic tooling are separated by design — not merged by convenience.

# 

# The emphasis is structural clarity over feature accumulation.

# 

# The Stack

# ForgeEcosystem

# 

# Constitutional layer

# 

# Defines invariants, membranes, and governance constraints.

# Sets the non-overrideable boundaries.

# 

# ConditionalBoundedness

# 

# Control-system architecture

# 

# Specifies switching behavior, contraction/expansion logic, and stopping criteria — always within constitutional bounds.

# 

# This layer governs how behavior adapts.

# 

# BoundedRuntime

# 

# Runtime rule deck

# 

# Provides deployable KBIN artifacts and coherence band modeling.

# 

# Introduces no new constitutional invariants.

# Implements and translates upstream architecture into portable runtime form.

# 

# DataDiddler

# 

# Deterministic semantic tooling

# 

# A mechanism-level tool for inspecting and structuring document meaning.

# 

# Operates independently of switching and governance layers.

# 

# Dependency Structure

# ForgeEcosystem → ConditionalBoundedness → BoundedRuntime

# 

# 

# DataDiddler operates at the tool layer.

# 

# Constitution governs invariants.

# 

# Control governs switching behavior.

# 

# Runtime governs deployment packaging.

# 

# Posture

# 

# This organization publishes versioned architectural artifacts in public.

# 

# It is not a product funnel.

# It is not a manifesto.

# It is not a feature aggregation surface.

# 

# Separation between layers is intentional — to reduce ambiguity, preserve audit surfaces, and prevent scope bleed.
