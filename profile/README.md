# Mettle Forge Lab

**Layered architectures for governable language systems.**

Mettle Forge Lab develops systems where constitutional constraints, switching logic, scalar regulation, runtime packaging, deterministic execution, and substrate hosting are separated by design — not merged by convenience.

The emphasis is **structural clarity over feature accumulation**.

---

## A workshop publishing versioned architectural artifacts in public.

## The Stack

### ForgeEcosystem  
**Constitutional layer**

Defines invariants, membranes, governance constraints, and escalation discipline.  
Sets non-overrideable boundaries for all downstream systems.

---

### ConditionalBoundedness  
**Switching control layer**

Specifies contraction/expansion behavior, mode transitions, and stopping criteria within constitutional bounds.

Governs how systems adapt — not what they are allowed to become.

---

### ARIA-Regulation-Layer  
**Scalar runtime regulation**

Implements deterministic readiness computation, gain scheduling, envelope enforcement, and commit-boundary discipline.

Includes:

- Cross-layer integrity contract  
- Bounded event membrane  
- Signal provenance standard  
- Governance escalation ladder  
- Multi-model consistency envelope  
- ζ-envelope convergence verification  

Introduces no new constitutional invariants.

---

### BoundedRuntime  
**Deployment rule deck**

Translates upstream architecture into portable runtime artifacts (KBIN, coherence bands).

Implements runtime packaging without modifying invariants or switching logic.

---

### DADI-Engine  
**Deterministic artifact execution substrate**

Provides reproducible, hash-verifiable execution and indexing.

Enforces byte-stable outputs, deterministic queries, and trust-governed mutation.

Forms the deterministic foundation beneath higher-level systems.

---

### DataDiddler  
**Deterministic semantic tooling**

A mechanism-level tool for inspecting and structuring document meaning.

Operates independently from switching, governance, and scalar regulation layers.

---

### LaForge (Substrate Stack)  
**Execution host and orchestration environment**

Provides:

- Dual-model serving  
- Chest Engine orchestration  
- Scroll mechanism layer  
- Domain engines  
- Observer and UI surfaces  
- Substrate guarantees required for ARIA hosting  

Implements execution without redefining governance layers.

---

## Dependency Structure

Constitution defines invariants.

Switching defines adaptive behavior.

Scalar regulation enforces bounded control.

Runtime packages deployable artifacts.

DADI ensures deterministic artifact execution.

Substrate hosts execution under declared guarantees.

Tooling operates at the semantic inspection layer.

No lower layer may redefine a higher one.

---

## Verification Posture

Where claims are made about bounded convergence, determinism, or envelope enforcement, verification artifacts are published.

Governance is enforced by contract, not convention.

---

## Posture

This organization publishes versioned architectural artifacts in public.

It is not:

- a product funnel  
- a manifesto  
- a feature aggregation surface  
- a personality system  
- an engagement optimization stack  

It is a layered engineering workshop.
```

This layer governs how behavior adapts.

---

### BoundedRuntime  
**Runtime rule deck**

Provides deployable KBIN artifacts and coherence band modeling.

Introduces **no new constitutional invariants**.  
Implements and translates upstream architecture into portable runtime form.

---

### DADI-Engine  
**Deterministic artifact execution substrate**

A reproducible, hash-verifiable execution and indexing engine.

Enforces byte-stable outputs, deterministic queries, and trust-governed mutation.

Provides the deterministic foundation beneath higher-level systems.

---

### DataDiddler  
**Deterministic semantic tooling**

A mechanism-level tool for inspecting and structuring document meaning.

Operates independently from switching and governance layers.

---

## Dependency Structure

- Constitution governs invariants.
- Control governs switching behavior.
- Runtime governs deployment packaging.
- DADI governs deterministic artifact execution.
- DataDiddler operates at the semantic tooling layer.
