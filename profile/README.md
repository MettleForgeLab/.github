# Mettle Forge Lab

**Layered architectures for governable language systems.**

Mettle Forge Lab develops systems where constitutional constraints, switching logic, scalar regulation, runtime packaging, and deterministic tooling are separated by design.

The emphasis is **structural clarity over feature accumulation**.

## A workshop publishing versioned architectural artifacts in public.

## Governance Stack (Upstream)

### ForgeEcosystem  
**Constitutional layer**

Defines invariants, membranes, governance constraints, and escalation discipline.  
Sets non-overrideable boundaries for all downstream systems.

---

### ConditionalBoundedness  
**Switching control layer**

Defines contraction and expansion logic under constitutional constraints.  
Does not define invariants or execution mechanics.

---

### ARIA-Regulation-Layer  
**Scalar regulation layer**

Defines:

- Event membrane enforcement  
- Configuration freeze boundaries  
- Deterministic telemetry classification  
- Governance escalation ladder  
- Multi-model consistency envelope  

Implements regulation contracts without redefining constitutional or switching logic.

---

### BoundedRuntime  
**Runtime packaging layer**

Provides portable KBIN artifacts implementing upstream governance and scalar regulation constraints.

Introduces no new invariants.

---

### DADI-Engine  
**Deterministic substrate layer**

Defines canonical artifact execution, toolchain constraint enforcement, fail-closed execution, and commit discipline.

---

### DataDiddler  
**Deterministic semantic tooling layer**

Provides deterministic inspection and semantic structuring of artifacts.  
Independent of governance and switching layers.

---

## LaForge Execution Stack (Downstream)

### laforge-substrate  
Hardware and container substrate for node bring-up.

---

### laforge-model-serving  
Stable A/B model endpoint exposure layer.

---

### forgeos-mechanisms  
Content-free control mechanisms and deterministic contract surfaces.

---

### forge-domains  
Declarative role, domain, ritual, and atlas bundles.

---

### chest-engine  
Runtime orchestration layer:

- Dual-model execution  
- Event membrane enforcement  
- Deterministic commit artifacts  
- Replay interface  

---

### weave-observer-ui  
Read-only visualization layer for replay inspection and observability.

---

### laforge-ops-verification  
Verification and certification layer:

- Deterministic replay enforcement  
- Compatibility matrix validation  
- Node certification  
- Governance escalation binding  

---

## Determinism Model

### Deterministic

- Routing decisions  
- Gating parameters  
- Configuration snapshots  
- Commit artifacts  
- Replay proofs  

### Not Deterministic

- Token sampling  

Governance applies to the control plane, not stochastic output.

---

## Design Posture

This organization is:

- Layered  
- Contract-first  
- Replay-verifiable  
- Audit-oriented  
- Local-first  

It is not:

- A monolith  
- A cloud abstraction  
- A personality stack  
- A feature funnel

Governance defines.  
Control constrains.  
Regulation enforces envelopes.  
Runtime packages.  
Substrate executes.  
Mechanisms compute.  
Domains declare.  
Chest orchestrates.  
UI observes.  
Ops verifies.
